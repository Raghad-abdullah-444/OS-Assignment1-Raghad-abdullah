## Question 1: Thread vs Process

**Question**: Explain the difference between a **thread** and a **process**. Why did we use threads in this assignment instead of creating separate processes?

**Your Answer:**

[Write your answer here. Consider: What is a process? What is a thread? How do they differ in terms of memory, resources, creation overhead? Why are threads more suitable for this simulation?]

## Question 2: Ready Queue Behavior

**Question**: In Round-Robin scheduling, what happens when a process doesn't finish within its time quantum? Explain using an example from your program output.

**Your Answer:**

[Write your answer here. Describe the specific behavior - where does the process go? When does it run again? Give an example from your actual program output showing a process that was re-queued.]

Example from my output:
```
[Paste a relevant snippet from your program output here showing a process being re-queued]
```

**Explanation of example:**
[Explain what's happening in the output snippet you pasted]

## Question 3: Thread States

**Question**: A thread can be in different states: **New**, **Runnable**, **Running**, **Waiting**, **Terminated**. Walk through these states for one process (P1) from your simulation.

**Your Answer:**

[Write your answer here. For each state, explain when P1 enters that state during the simulation. Use your understanding of the code to trace through the lifecycle.]

1. **New**: P1 is i n new state -> after new process is called in addprocesstoqueue() creating the thread before it stats-new procees will be in queue before take it by cpu 

2. **Runnable**: p1 become runnable when currentthread.start() is called in the main scheduling loop,making it ready for cpu.

3. **Running**: p1 is running when operating system scheduler patches/select the p1 and begins executing the run() method,calculating run time and processing its quantum

4. **Waiting**: p1 is become in waiting state when thread.sleep(sleepTime) is called during execution to simulate work progress   
the main thread also wais via currentthread.join() for p1 to complete

5. **Terminated**: p1 is terminated whent the run() method return normally after completing its quantum or finishing entirely via runtocompletion()

## Question 4: Real-World Applications

**Question**: Give **TWO** real-world examples where Round-Robin scheduling with threads would be useful. Explain why this scheduling algorithm works well for those scenarios.

**Your Answer:**

### Example 1: [Name of application/scenario]

**Description**: 
[Describe the real-world scenario or application]

**Why Round-Robin works well here**: 
[Explain why Round-Robin scheduling is suitable. Consider fairness, responsiveness, predictability, etc.]

### Example 2: [Name of application/scenario]

**Description**: 
[Describe the real-world scenario or application]

**Why Round-Robin works well here**: 
[Explain why Round-Robin scheduling is suitable. Consider fairness, responsiveness, predictability, etc.]
